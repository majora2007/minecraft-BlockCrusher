BlockCrusher extends the functionality of Pistons in Minecraft to allow blocks to break when pushed against a block which is _un-pushable_. Instead of not pushing any more blocks, the plugin allows for blocks to break naturally. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nThe plugin allows for three different methods of breaking blocks:\r\n\r\n1. First - The block being pushed is broken.\r\n2. Last - The block being pushed against an _un-pushable_ is broken.\r\n3. All - All blocks from the block being pushed to the last block are broken.\r\n\r\n","name":"Blockcrusher","tagline":"BlockCrusher: Extends functionality of Pistons to allow blocks to break","google":""}
